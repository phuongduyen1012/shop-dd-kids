This setup has a few benefits:\n✑ Simplicity: your NuGet.config, .npmrc, or settings.xml contains exactly one feed (your feed).\n✑ Determinism: your feed resolves package requests in order, so rebuilding the same codebase at the same commit or changeset uses the same set of packages\n✑ Provenance: your feed knows the provenance of packages it saved via upstream sources, so you can verify that you&#39;re using the original package, not a custom or malicious copy published to your feed\n✑ Peace of mind: packages used via upstream sources are guaranteed to be saved in the feed on first use; if the upstream source is disabled/removed, or the remote feed goes down or deletes a package you depend on, you can continue to develop and build\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/concepts/upstream-sources?view=vsts"
