While that pipeline is running, additional pushes B and C occur into the repository. These updates do not start new independent runs immediately. But after the first run is completed, all pushes until that point of time are batched together and a new run is started.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github"

Instead of moving your entire project to GitLab, you can connect your external repository to get the benefits of GitLab CI/CD.\nNote: When a pipeline uses a remote, 3rd-party repository host such as Bitbucket Cloud, the repository is configured with webhooks that notify Azure Pipelines\nServer or TFS when code has changed and a build should be triggered. Since on-premises installations are normally protected behind a firewall, 3rd-party webhooks are unable to reach the on-premises server. As a workaround, you can use the External Git repository type which uses polling instead of webhooks to trigger a build when code has changed.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/pipeline-options-for-git"
