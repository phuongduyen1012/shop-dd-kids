        "explanation": "For me the correct answer is A, Readers.\nI understand the people who answer D because the Microsoft documentation (see link below) is really badly written and contradictory. However relying on the table showing the default permissions you can see that readers and contributors have write access to their own queries and not to the shared ones. Surely a contributor can receive write access from an administrator to shared queries as well. I don&#39;t know about the reader. So I decided to test the functionality directly on the Azure DevOps portal and it works. With a reader user I was able to create and save a query to MyQueries. Not only that, I was also able to create the charts. I think Readers is the correct choice also because the access is provided to a project manager who is only interested in monitoring activities and making a report to show to other people (for example customers or managers). In fact it is not required anywhere in the question that the queries are shared.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/set-query-permissions?view=azure-devops#default-query-permissions"
