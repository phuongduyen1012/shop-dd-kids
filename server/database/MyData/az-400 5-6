        "question": "You have a private distribution group that contains provisioned and unprovisioned devices.You need to distribute a new iOS application to the distribution group by using Microsoft Visual Studio App Center.What should you do?",
        "answers": [
          "A. Request the Apple ID associated with the user of each device.",

          "D. Add the device owner to the organization in App Center."
        ],
        "explanation": "When releasing an iOS app signed with an ad-hoc or development provisioning profile, you must obtain tester&#39;s device IDs (UDIDs), and add them to the provisioning profile before compiling a release. When you enable the distribution group&#39;s Automatically manage devices setting, App Center automates the before mentioned operations and removes the constraint for you to perform any manual tasks. As part of automating the workflow, you must provide the user name and password for your Apple ID and your production certificate in a .p12 format.\nApp Center starts the automated tasks when you distribute a new release or one of your testers registers a new device. First, all devices from the target distribution group will be registered, using your Apple ID, in your developer portal and all provisioning profiles used in the app will be generated with both new and existing device ID. Afterward, the newly generated provisioning profiles are downloaded to App Center servers.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/groups"

        "explanation": "The basic idea behind Continuous Assurance (CA) is to setup the ability to check for &quot;drift&quot; from what is considered a secure snapshot of a system. Support for\nContinuous Assurance lets us treat security truly as a &#39;state&#39; as opposed to a &#39;point in time&#39; achievement. This is particularly important in today&#39;s context when\n&#39;continuous change&#39; has become a norm.\nThere can be two types of drift:\n✑ Drift involving &#39;baseline&#39; configuration: This involves settings that have a fixed number of possible states (often pre-defined/statically determined ones). For instance, a SQL DB can have TDE encryption turned ON or OFFג€¦or a Storage Account may have auditing turned ON however the log retention period may be less than 365 days.\n✑ Drift involving &#39;stateful&#39; configuration: There are settings which cannot be constrained within a finite set of well-known states. For instance, the IP addresses configured to have access to a SQL DB can be any (arbitrary) set of IP addresses. In such scenarios, usually human judgment is initially required to determine whether a particular configuration should be considered &#39;secure&#39; or not. However, once that is done, it is important to ensure that there is no &quot;stateful drift&quot; from the attested configuration. (E.g., if, in a troubleshooting session, someone adds the IP address of a developer machine to the list, the Continuous Assurance feature should be able to identify the drift and generate notifications/alerts or even trigger &#39;auto-remediation&#39; depending on the severity of the change).\nReference:\nhttps://azsk.azurewebsites.net/04-Continous-Assurance/Readme.html"
