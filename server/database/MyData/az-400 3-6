        "explanation": "IMHO the correct answer is A.\n1. Many of you points to the difference between assigning and procuring licenses. But actually there no difference.\n&quot;We simplified Azure DevOps billing, so now rather than complete a purchase process, you assign and remove users. You get billed according to those assignments. This article helps you take advantage of the tools we have for managing paid access for users. This way you only pay for what you need.&quot;\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=azure-devops\n\n2. You can easily automate user adding to Azure Devops Teams by assigning AAD groups to the DevOps Teams.\n3. The same could be with entitlements\n4. You could automate azure devops users group memberships using group rules. Yes, you can do it but only the first time you ASSIGN the membership to the users. If after some days you want to change this membership how do you think to di it automatically? Of course you can&#39;t, because now you can&#39;t know which group you want to assign a particular user to in several days. This operation, &quot;modifying group memberships&quot; is to be done manually."

Contributors to the topic branch work how they want in the topic branch, and the default branches keep a linear history through the use of squash merges.
